# *Summary

Layman-friendly 2 sentence summary.

# *Abstract

~200 word description of the issue being addressed.

# *Motivation

Explain why the existing Protocol / Governance / Permission specification is inadequate to address the problem that this PIP solves.

For Permission PIPs, describe the motivations of the individual/team volunteering for the permission.

# Specification

*For Protocol/Governance PIPs, outline a technical specification of the proposed upgrade, detailed enough to facilitate implementation.

# *Rationale

For Protocol/Governance PIPs, justify design decisions in the specification. Where relevant, acknowledge alternate designs that were considered and explain why they were discarded. All potential security considerations must be highlighted and addressed.

Should also reference relevant community discussions and how their concerns are addressed by this PIP.

## *Dissenting Opinions

Should acknowledge all opinions which disagree with the rationale of this proposal.

# *Viability

For Protocol PIPs, test cases are mandatory for upgrades which affect consensus, but optional for all other upgrades. Justifications should also be made as to the suitability of the implementers.

For Governance PIPs, where possible, reference simulations or alternative scientific testing methods.

For Permission PIPs, explain why the background/skill set of the individual/team makes them suitable for the permission.

# Implementation

PIP won't be given Execution status until the Implementation is complete.

# Audit

For Protocol PIPs, this should include the details of the auditor and their final audit report.

For Permission PIPs, this should include whatever background checks are required for the role.

# Footnotes

Links or references that support any claims made in the proposal.
